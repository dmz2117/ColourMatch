Description:

My initial learning experience site was dedicated to understanding light and colour, and how our brains can see all colours by simply mixing different amounts of the three colours our eyes can detect. Through this experience, and seeing the interactive model I created, I thought it would be fun to turn it into a game.

ColourMatch is a game that lets you control blue, green, and red sliders to match 10 different colours that appear in the match area. If your slider values are all within 20 units of the target colour, it counts as a match, and moves to the next challenge.

The play area consists of a central zone containing three bars of colour (blue, green, and red) that change width depending on the slider value. They appear to end at a solid block of colour that represents a mix between the three values (RGB values). On the left is a list of completed challenges, and on the right are the sliders and the current and next challenge.

The initial three colours are easy secondary colours that are part of an array. The additional 7 colours are added to the array and generated at random using a loop. A final BootStrap card appears when all challenges have been completed.

A timer and score feature are also visible, but due to time constraints are not functional. A name entry window is also in the code, but not used.
